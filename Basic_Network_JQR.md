## Intro to mapping/asset inventory
### ELOs
#### Examine security concepts
* it's important to identify "rogue systems": they are different IoT devices that are connected to the network without having proper security protocols in place
* how do you detect rogue systems:
* network scans
* port scans
* intrusion detection systems
* Endpoint security solutions: antivirus, firewalls
* AD analysis: anallysing an organization's network documentation
* banner grabbing
* Passive: only captures information being sent to the system, without sending any requests to the victim system, therefore, a low risk of detection
* Active: packets are sent to the target to analyze the response data. This involves the establishment of a connection between the host and the target client

## Intro to MITRE ATT&CK
### ELOs
#### Explain how registry keys are used from an adversary perspective
* persistence in a target device can be achieved by altering registry keys such as HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
#### Discuss the importance of footprinting and fingerprinting
* identify the function of network services
* mapping an organization's network; finding key points and personnel of interest
#### Discuss the importance of probing and enumeration
* connecting to many netowork ports and IP address to see their response
#### Discuss adversary offensive actions in relation to the MITRE ATT&CK framework

#### Describe how an adversary removes evidence
* obfuscating code, using rootkits, or employing encryption to conceal malicious activities
#### Describe data mining
* Identifying servers containing databases and stealing the data directly
#### Explain security measures when given an adversary TTP

#### Explain security controls to detect and inhibit known adversary TTP

## Intro to Network Traffic Analysis
* cyber kill chain: seven-step methodology developed by Lockheed Martin, outlining the steps an attacker takes to infiltrate a network or system
* MITRE ATT%CK matrix: comprehensive knowledge base of attack techniques and tactics based on real-world observations
### ELOs
#### Understand methods for identifying adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) from MITRE
* monitoring for suspicious network traffic that could be indicative of probing for email addresses and/or usernames, such as large/iterative quantities of authentication requests originating from a single source
* using malware forensics, up-to-date antivirus software, or a known malware database
#### Understand the common Command and Control (C2) beaconing methods and attributes

#### Understand obfuscation techniques

#### Understand Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing

#### Understand different types of attack methods, including Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) attacks

#### Understand data exfiltration techniques
  
#### Understand link and timeline analysis
