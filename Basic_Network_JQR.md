#### Examine security concepts
* it's important to identify "rogue systems": they are different IoT devices that are connected to the network without having proper security protocols in place
* how do you detect rogue systems:
* network scans
* port scans
* intrusion detection systems
* Endpoint security solutions: antivirus, firewalls
* AD analysis: anallysing an organization's network documentation
* banner grabbing
* Passive: only captures information being sent to the system, without sending any requests to the victim system, therefore, a low risk of detection
* Active: packets are sent to the target to analyze the response data. This involves the establishment of a connection between the host and the target client
